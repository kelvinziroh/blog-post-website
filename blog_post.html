            <h2>What is Ecole 42 and why should you care?</h2>
            <p>
                Okay, so some of you might not know what <a href="https://www.42.us.org/" target="_blank">Ecole 42</a>  is 
                much less care why it's relevant anyways. Fair enough. Well allow me to break it down for you. 42 Silicon 
                Valley is a college-level, tuition-free, computer programming school with a peer-to-peer learning environment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes you read it right. You pay nothing before admission and nothing after getting a job. Wait, there's more... here's 
                where the magic happens. There are no teachers in this school. Instead, they have a peer-to-peer pedagogy. Students 
                get to learn from each other. Incase you haven't realised how profound that is, <strong>they get to be mentors while 
                being mentored by their fellow students(or mentees/mentors)</strong>. How cool is that?
            </p>
            <p>
                Ready for more? They have no classes. Wow, this is really mind blowing to me, I don't know about you 
                guys but this is so counter-intuitive. this allows student to venture into whatever part of program they see fit for 
                themselves. This is a pretty awesome way to learn if you ask me, and it's not the only one of it's kind.  
            </p>
            <p>
                So here are the rest that work in some way close to what 42 is doing;
            </p>
            <h2>Holberton School</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/" target="_blank">Holberton School</a> is pretty similar to 42 only that the 
                student pays a certain percentage back to the school only after he/she has been hired with a salary that exceeds a 
                certain amount. This is so cool. In some way the students success is guaranteed because the school does not succeed 
                if its student don't thrive in the work place. Like 42, they've no classes instead, their program is project-based. Still 
                no teachers here, you learn from your peers while teaching something to your peers. 
            </p>
            <h2>Udacity</h2>
            <p>
                Okay, let's back up a bit. So these schools have a pretty awesome teaching methodology and this is not all of them. 
                There are still very many you can find where you learn computer science concepts at the comfort of your home couch. One 
                of the best out there you could check out right now is <a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>. 
                Absolutely ground-breaking. I like how they have sectioned their courses into schools just like in college so you have 
                an easy time finding a course from programming all the way to data science if you like playing around with numbers. 
                They also have various services like mentor support and career services. It's not free but totally worth it.
            </p>
            <p>And now comes the question <strong>"So what?"</strong></p>
            <h2>Where's the relevance</h2>
            <p>
                Okay, so you're probably thinking,"So what?". Here's what. I sampled these three schools to show you something, a missing 
                link in the traditional learning methodology. Don't get me wrong, am not saying that our current educational systems 
                should be thrown away at once and forgotten and these new ones from the mentioned above adopted right away. Our current 
                systems are good for some courses or paths but definitely not all. Infact most paths require some form of apprenticeship 
                program which will aid in making most people ready for the jobs emerging in the new future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a quote by <strong>Cathy Davidson</strong> that sums up why we need to rethink our current methodology and why you, 
                my friend, should care;
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/279365">
                "Sixty-five percent of children entering grade school this year will end up working in careers that havenâ€™t even been 
                invented yet."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                See here's the thing. Apparently a lot of the stuff that humans are currently doing that involve cognition can easily be
                automated. Well what does that mean. It means that the Artificial Intelligence crusade is out to get you bucko!!! Anyways
                am kidding. Seriously though, most of the cognitive tasks can be automated and this, unfortunately will coz problems for 
                people who are left behind not able to interact with these machines much less use them to their advantage. On the flip side 
                of the coin, those able to learn rapidly and acquire complex skills that allow them to take advantage of the autonomy will 
                have a head-start advantage.
            </p>
            <p>
                So who are these advantaged and disadvantaged. Let's take a step back and look at the traditional model of education and the 
                upcoming ones.
            </p>
            <h2>Traditional Methodology vs upcoming methodology</h2>
            <img src="img/Cars-3-Daytona-500-Trailer.jpg" alt="Jackson Storm beating Lightning McQueen" class="article-image">
            <p>
                I know, I know...It's just a cartoon. But allow me to use it as a metaphor. For those who haven't watched pixar's third 
                cars sequel, above is a photo of Jackson Storm, a rookie, beating all time legendary racer, Lightning McQueen. From the 
                animation, natalie, a statistical analyst, explains how Storm(upcoming) was able to beat the veteran legend(traditional) 
                by taking advantage of his new design models(methodology) like an optimized drive train, an aero-dynamic profile, lower 
                center of gravity, lighter weight components, bla bla bla, none of which McQueen had.
            </p>
            <p>
                Put simply, McQueen was not ready to face the next generation of young racers like Storm. Does it all make sense now? The 
                traditional learning methodology(McQueen) uses old ways to pass down information or educate unlike the upcoming learning 
                methodologies(Storm) experienced in 42, Holberton, Udacity and others alike. These new schools are currently setting the 
                pace of what true education should be. Instead of putting students in long, boring, three-hour lectures where all they are 
                fed is obsolete theoritical facts in the face of advancements in technology at an exhilirating pace, The rookie sensation 
                in our education context is teaching students how to learn, and then how to use whatever they've learnt and think critically 
                to solve problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quick question here? Who is more likely to get hired, a scholar graduate with absolutely nothing but a flashy credential
                that shows no experience at all, or someone with actual skills and can get the job done with maximum efficiency. Well both 
                of them are in current times in someway disadvantaged to be honest. But just imagine who is more likely to thrive? You 
                guessed right. The one with actual skills has a huge advantage considering that all he/she needs is a way of showing his/her 
                prospective employer of what he/she is capable of.   
            </p>
            <p>
                All this, and we've barely scratched the surface of what these "rookie" schools are doing differently. Lemme spoil one for 
                you as I wrap it all up. Udacity has industrial experts as its instructors. Compare that with lecturers especially in third 
                world country universities who have nothing but degrees, pHd's and little or no experience. There, all tied up for ya! The 
                lesson learnt from 42 compared to our traditional education model or Storm compared to McQueen if you'd prefer that and why
                it's important now more than ever you started rethinking what education is to you and how you should go about it because 
                it has a direct impact on your life in the future. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, hope that was an enlightening insight for you. Think, daydream and even sleep on it if you will. Now until next time.
                May the force be with you!
